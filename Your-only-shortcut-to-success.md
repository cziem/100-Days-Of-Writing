# Your Only Shortcut To Success

Most people look for shortcuts to everything. Do they really exist? Are they really helpful?

Well I may not have the answers you are looking for. But there is one sure truth that has been around, and I summarize it like this

> Shortcuts will cut you short!

Yes, you heard me. Shortcuts will cut you short and bring you tears which you did not bargain for.

__The only shortcut to success is EDUCATION.__

Successful people are very educated people. I know you've read of how a lot of the most successful and wealthy people around today dropped out of school and stories like that. You may first have to redefine Education for yourself. And we will do that just that together.

## What is Education

Education is the process of acquiring knowledge. This can be done in a formal setting or an informal setting.

Before the advent of schools people were being educated. The process of education is the process of acquiring knowledge about a thing, applying the knowledge and verifying it yields the expected result. Proper education requires a lot of practice. You are too far away from success because you are too concerned with theories, most of which you won't apply.

Head knowledge is not the same with experinced knowledge. You need to move beyound reading and learning to acting and practising.

Practicing solidifies what you have learnt. You practice until it becomes part of you. Good practice will ensure you get good success.

Dr. Stephen R. Covey said, “We control our actions, but the consequences that flow from those actions are controlled by principles.”

Learning these control principles come from actual practice. You have to learn them, then go ahead and apply them.

## Shortcut Breeds Weakness

People who are always looking for shortcuts ultimately become lazy. The reason is simple. Shortcuts take away the required process. Process takes time and demands patience.

Thus if you are used to shortcuts, things that involve processes will bore you. And when you become bored you lose interest. That is how laziness comes.
