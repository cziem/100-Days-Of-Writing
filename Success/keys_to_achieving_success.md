## Planning and Forecasting

Success comes with great plans, I don't know what your views are, but people don't stumble on success. If you want to be successful, you are going to plan and work your way through it.

A wise quote says:
> If you have failed to plan, then you have planned to fail

Having a plan involves identifying the __How__, __Why__, __When__, __Where__ and __Who__. Taking these logistics into consideration will greatly increase your chances of succeeding.
