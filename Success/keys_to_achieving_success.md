## Planning and Forecasting

Success comes with great plans, I don't know what your views are, but people don't stumble on success. If you want to be successful, you are going to plan and work your way through it.

A wise quote says:
> If you have failed to plan, then you have planned to fail

Having a plan involves identifying the __How__, __Why__, __When__, __Where__ and __Who__. Taking these logistics into consideration will greatly increase your chances of succeeding. Your plan must be detailed, precise and informing. When you look at your plan, you should tell where you are from where you want to be. In this article [tracking result](https://medium.com/ignyte/tracking-result-ab94f73d49cc) there are lucid principles on building a plan that  keeps you in track.

I like to look at plans as visual aids and roadmaps to the future, you could embed milestones, time-limits, road maps and more to make your planning more effective. A visual plan also keeps you engaged, motivated and in control of your actions because it clearly shows you where you are and how you are faring. This is the basic concept behind `forecasting`.

Forecasting brings you into the future, gives you the power to model it and struture it the way you prefer. Think of forecasting as an elaborate feasibility study, strategizing and projection of the future.

A good forecasting strategy would involve a clear step by step procedure of arriving at your big picture. For example, say you run a hair saloon / treatment business, and you have little or no capital to start your business. First step; get your plans ready. This plan should be the `Big Picture`.
