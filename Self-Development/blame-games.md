## Overview

Control is a concious to direct the current course of event to a determined end. This often entrusts us with a lot of responsibilities, one that finds us intuitively reculling all dexterity within our arsenal to ensure continuability and success ultimately. In retrospect, things are bound to fall short, expectations crash our threshold barrier, plans fail, efforts demeaned, purpose tharwted. When life brings us to these inevitable junctions, what will your response be?

You play a game, the blame game.
